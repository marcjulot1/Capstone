Assignment 1 - Evolution 1 - Assessing Data Analytics
Data Analytics


What do you know - Competencies, skills, and knowledge where you are the most confident and proficient?

West Texas A & M University’s Computer Information System and Business Analytics program allowed for a student without any technical background to gain the skills needed to succeed in a professional setting where I can leverage my analytical skills in modern businesses. I learned Data Analytic skills through different tools that allowed for the analysis and reporting on data that has been extracted. As a person who has taken a business leadership class at WTAMU and opened my own LLC in Texas, I would say I possess business acumen, as well as leadership skills. That is a strong suit of mine. The CISBA program though helped me developed being able to utilize data to tell a story for any future business I may have or future company I may work for. Through the usage of Power Bi and Tableau from pass courses, I have learned that the visualization of data is not only important, but it is vital when it comes to disseminating data to stake holders. The easier it is to follow, the more appealing the visualization becomes. 

I have also learned how to use Python modules such as Pandas, Numpy and Pyplot to help with the visualization of data and as well as the control of data. I have become accustomed to the language and can manage a great deal of data. This also means that I can utilize PowerBi to connect to databases that allows for integration, such as DB Browser.  While in this program, I often focused on its four goals. The first goal of professional communication was relevant all throughout the course work in the program. This is very important when it comes to being a data analyst. Throughout my time at the program, I have written reports independently and in team settings that allowed me to explain the bigger picture of the course that I was enrolled in. I have been able to utilize Jupyter notebook with teammates to help visualize data through python coding. In every course I was able to stick to the second goal of the CISBA program which is critical thinking. I used critical thinking skills to solve different problems. This meant that I used data analytic tools to help recommend solutions.

 Although I did not have a business role throughout the program, that program perfectly helped simulate the business environment where I was tasked with solving problems that I will one day see in the professional setting. I learned about ethical practices in the program, as well as understanding that stakeholders in business environments can be global. Lastly the focus of the last goal was to integrate Computer Information Systems theory into my repertoire. This meant that I understand what it means to manage a project from start to finish, it also meant that I could analyze data as well as create data.

The realm of computer information systems is so vast that it may take PhD level of knowledge to cover every minute details of it. This is to say, although the WTAMU CISBA program is an amazing program that I will never regret paying for, I know there are some skills that I wished that I gained out of the program. 



Where are you weak - Competencies, skills, and knowledge where you are lest confident and proficient?
Although I am strong at coming up with ideas, my weakness lays in the fact that I have not had a business role. I am to start as a system project analyst after graduating. It looks like I just must be aware in having live stakeholders that I am pressured to succeed for. I need real time experience to fully understand what it means to be a data analyst. Although I have the skills, it does not mean that I only need the skills alone.

What do you wish you knew and/or don't realize you are missing?
I wish that I had more tangible experience as a Data Analyst. I also wished that I learned Microsoft Access. Since I did not have a lot of exposure to it, it is something that I am placed on my do to list when it comes to learning. I want more exposure with cloud computing and data analyzing through that means. This might mean, being more accustomed to programs other than Microsoft teams to edit data in real time.

Summary Statement of Competence
A summary statement of your capabilities, competencies, and propensity to capitalize on this work in future settings.

My time at WTAMU CISBA program has enabled me to become a Data-Driven individual. Currently data is all around us.  There is a massive volume of data being produced daily. This means that the analysis of data is important for businesses globally. Being data-driven means that I will help companies make decisions based on the data that they have. As a data analyst, it means the professional can turn raw data into company insights that will have an impact on the direction they choose to go. The fact that in the program there were many time limits to adhere to allowed me to work efficiently while also being productive and being cognizant of timelines. The assignments allowed me to view my professor as the stakeholders who required a finished product. Analysis of data helps companies manage risk and place themselves in the best possible position when it comes to the global market. Knowing this knowledge will help me when I do become a data analyst. 


Contribution Towards the Capstone

•	Why Data Analytics is integratable with the other areas?
Data is everywhere. The ability to analyses and manipulate data is important to our modern society. In every instance of our existence data can be collected.
•	How Data Analytics is integratable with the other areas
You can utilize data analytics when it comes to decision making. Data analytics can help decision making in a business, in a classroom, in a local government, state government or even federal government. 
•	How Data Analytics is integratable with your prior work
As a former teacher I used data analytics to track my student data and make projections on how my students would grow throughout the year. As a former investigator, analyzed all the data I received to make safety determinations for clients. 
•	What new statement can you make that demonstrates that these all fit.
The analysis of data will continue to be important no matter what career path I take.
